# Core Question
How can emotional recovery in children be described as a dynamic process rather than a fixed score?
In this project, recovery is considered as a combination of observable behavioral and emotional indicators.
Self-report is not the primary focus. Instead, recovery will be inferred from:
- Re-engagement with the task after mild frustration
- Changes in visible distress signals
- Behavioral flexibility following an error
- Latency before returning to goal-directed activity
The focus is on how these markers unfold over time.
These notes are exploratory and may change with further refinement.
