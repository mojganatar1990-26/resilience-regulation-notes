# Adaptive Difficulty (Preliminary Logic)
The task difficulty should adapt to the child’s performance in order to keep the challenge in a manageable range.
Goal:
Maintain "optimal challenge" where regulation and recovery can be observed,without creating prolonged distress or complete disengagement.
How difficulty changes (simple rule set):
- If the child is consistently successful with low distress:
  increase difficulty slightly.
- If the child shows strong distress (intensity 3) or repeated distress episodes:decrease difficulty or introduce a brief recovery-friendly step.
- If the child shows low distress but also low engagement (e.g., no attempts, turning away): adjust the task to invite re-engagement (e.g., simplify one step, give a clearer goal),rather than interpreting this as high resilience.
Notes:
- Low distress alone should not be treated as resilience.
- Recovery should still require return to task-oriented behavior.
- Stop criteria and ethical safeguards must override adaptation rules when needed.
This logic is preliminary and will need refinement after pilot observation.
