# Regulation Trajectory (Preliminary Notes)

Rather than focusing on a single distress–recovery episode, this project is interested in the overall pattern of regulation across the entire task.
Key questions include:
- How many distress episodes occur during the task?
- Does recovery become faster or slower over time?
- Does distress intensity escalate or decrease across episodes?
- Are recovery phases stable or fragile?
The goal is to observe regulation as a dynamic process,not as a single event.
These ideas are exploratory and will require structured coding before empirical testing.
