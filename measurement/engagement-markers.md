# Engagement Markers (Preliminary)

Because low distress can sometimes reflect disengagement or shutdown,this project also tracks observable engagement during the task.
Engagement is defined as active involvement in the task, such as:
- Making repeated attempts (even if unsuccessful)
- Sustained attention toward the goal (looking, tracking, orienting)
- Manipulating materials in a task-relevant way
- Trying alternative strategies after an error
- Accepting prompts and returning to the task after a pause
Low engagement indicators may include:
- No attempts for a sustained period
- Turning away and staying disengaged
- Minimal interaction with materials without goal-directed behavior
Engagement will be considered alongside distress and recovery,especially when interpreting "low distress" cases.
These markers are preliminary and will require clearer timing rules.
