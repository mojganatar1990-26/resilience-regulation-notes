# Recovery Definition (Preliminary)
Recovery is defined as a transition from observable distress to a stable, goal-directed state following mild frustration.
Recovery does not require a complete absence of emotional activation (level 0). 
Instead, it requires:
1. Distress intensity decreasing to level 1
2. Stability at level 1 for approximately 20–30 continuous seconds
3. Observable return to task-oriented behavior
Recovery is not defined as passive calming or emotional shutdown. The child must demonstrate active re-engagement with the task.
Indicators of re-engagement may include:
- Resuming manipulation of materials
- Attempting the task again
- Sustained visual attention toward the goal
- Flexible adjustment after an error
Recovery is considered complete only when reduced distress is accompanied by functional task engagement.
This definition is preliminary and may require refinement after pilot observation.
