# Recovery Definition (Preliminary)
Recovery is defined as a dynamic shift from observable distress to a stable, goal-directed state following mild frustration.
Recovery does not require a complete absence of emotional activation (level 0). 
Instead, it is defined as:
1. Distress intensity decreasing to level 1
2. Stability at level 1 for approximately 20–30 continuous seconds
3. Observable re-engagement with the task
Re-engagement indicators may include:
- Resuming manipulation of materials
- Attempting the task again
- Sustained visual attention toward the goal
- Problem-solving behaviors
Recovery is considered complete when the child demonstrates both reduced distress intensity and active task engagement.
This definition is preliminary and may be refined based on feasibility and empirical testing.
