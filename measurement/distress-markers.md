# Observable Distress Markers (Preliminary Coding Framework)
In this project, distress is defined through observable behavioral and emotional indicators during a mild frustration task.
Distress will be coded along three dimensions:
1. Type of distress behavior
2. Intensity (rated on a simple scale)
3. Duration
Behavioral Categories:
Crying / Vocal Distress:
- Audible crying
- Repeated distress sounds (e.g., whining, protesting)
- Visible tears
Avoidance / Withdrawal:
- Turning away from the task
- Pushing materials aside
- Lack of engagement for a sustained period
Aggressive Response:
- Throwing objects
- Hitting the table or task materials
- Sudden forceful movements directed at the task
Intensity (Preliminary 0–3 scale):
0 = No observable distress
1 = Mild signs (brief protest or tension)
2 = Clear distress behavior lasting several seconds
3 = Strong and sustained distress response
Duration:
Distress episodes will be timed from the first observable marker to a noticeable reduction in intensity.
This coding structure is preliminary and requires further refinement and reliability testing.
