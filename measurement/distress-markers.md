# Observable Distress Markers (Preliminary Framework)
In this project, distress is defined through observable behavioral and emotional indicators during a mild frustration task.
Distress will be coded along three dimensions:
1. Type of behavior
2. Intensity (0–3 scale)
3. Duration
Behavioral Categories:
Crying / Vocal Distress:
- Audible crying
- Repeated protest sounds (e.g., whining)
- Visible tears
Avoidance / Withdrawal:
- Turning away from the task
- Pushing materials aside
- Lack of engagement for a noticeable period
Aggressive Response:
- Throwing objects
- Hitting the table or materials
- Forceful movements directed at the task
Intensity Scale (Preliminary):
0 = No observable distress  
1 = Mild signs of distress (brief protest, visible tension)  
2 = Clear distress behavior lasting several seconds  
3 = Strong and sustained distress response  
Duration:
A distress episode begins at the first observable marker and continues until the intensity decreases to level 1, and then remains stable for a short, continuous period (e.g., 20–30 seconds).
Level 1 is considered a low, manageable level of distress rather than a complete absence of emotional activation.
This framework is preliminary and will require further refinement, including clearer timing rules and inter-rater reliability testing.
