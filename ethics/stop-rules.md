# Safety and Stop Rules (Preliminary)
Because this project involves mild frustration, clear safety rules are essential.
The task should be stopped or adjusted if any of the following occur:
- Distress intensity stays at level 3 for more than ~20–30 seconds
- Distress episodes repeat without clear recovery
- The child becomes increasingly aggressive or unsafe with materials
- The child shows signs of shutdown (e.g., freezing, disengaging completely)
- The child verbally requests to stop (when applicable) or strongly resists continuing
If a stop rule is triggered, the response should prioritize regulation and comfort:
- Reduce difficulty immediately or switch to a neutral step
- Offer a brief calming break
- End the task if distress does not reduce
These rules are preliminary and should be refined during pilot observation.
