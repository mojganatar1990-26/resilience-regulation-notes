# resilience-regulation-notes
Ongoing research notes on emotional regulation and recovery in children.
This repository contains my ongoing notes related to emotional regulation and resilience in children.
I am especially interested in how emotional recovery can be understood as a process, not only as an outcome score.
The documents here include early conceptual ideas, theoretical reflections, and initial thoughts on measurement.
This space is still developing and may evolve over time.
