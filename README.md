# resilience-regulation-notes
Ongoing research notes on emotional regulation and recovery in children.
This repository contains my ongoing notes related to emotional regulation and resilience in children.
I am especially interested in how emotional recovery can be understood as a process, not only as an outcome score.
The documents here include early conceptual ideas, theoretical reflections, and initial thoughts on measurement.
This space is still developing and may evolve over time.
There is also a small synthetic dataset under /data and a simple R script under /analysis to demonstrate basic trajectory-style summaries.
