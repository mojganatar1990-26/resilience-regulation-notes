# Project Overview
This repository documents early-stage research notes on emotional regulation and resilience in children.
Current structure:
- Concept: core research questions and theoretical framing
- Measurement: distress coding, recovery definition, engagement markers
- Adaptive Logic: difficulty adjustment principles
- Ethics: safety and stop rules
The goal is to examine regulation as a dynamic process across the full trajectory of a frustration task.
All materials are preliminary and subject to refinement.
